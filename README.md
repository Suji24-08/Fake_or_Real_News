In the digital age, the rapid spread of misinformation has become a serious challenge, especially across social media and online news platforms. The Fake News Detection project aims to address this issue by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to automatically classify news articles as real or fake.

This system uses labeled datasets of real and fake news to train a predictive model. The text is preprocessed using techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and removal of stopwords. TF-IDF vectorization is applied to extract meaningful features, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used to perform the classification. The model is then evaluated for accuracy and can be used to predict the authenticity of new, unseen news articles.

This solution provides a foundational step toward combating misinformation online and highlights the power of AI in improving information credibility and public awareness.
